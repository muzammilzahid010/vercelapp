## What is Git? 🤔

Git is a **version control system** that helps you:
- Track changes to your code
- Save different versions of your website
- Collaborate with other developers
- Go back to previous versions if something breaks

Think of it like **save points in a video game** - you can always go back to a previous save point!

---

## Current Status 📊

Your project already has Git initialized! Let's check what's happening:

### Current Changes:
- ❌ `src/app/files/page.tsx` - **DELETED**
- 📝 `src/app/page.tsx` - **MODIFIED**

This means you have some changes that need to be saved.

---

## Basic Git Commands 📝

### 1. Check Status
```bash
git status
```
Shows you what files have changed.

### 2. See What Changed
```bash
git diff
```
Shows the exact changes made to your files.

### 3. Add Files to Save
```bash
# Add a specific file
git add src/app/page.tsx

# Add all changes
git add .

# Add deleted files
git add src/app/files/page.tsx
```

### 4. Save Your Changes (Commit)
```bash
git commit -m "Your message here"
```
This creates a **save point** with a message describing what you changed.

### 5. See Your Save Points
```bash
git log --oneline
```
Shows all your previous commits.

---

## Daily Workflow 🔄

### Every time you make changes to your website:

1. **Check what changed**
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. **Add the changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. **Commit with a clear message**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Fixed the login button styling"
   ```

### Example Messages:
- ✅ `"Added new cartoon generation feature"`
- ✅ `"Fixed responsive design on mobile"`
- ✅ `"Updated homepage text"`
- ❌ `"stuff"` (bad message)
- ❌ `"changes"` (bad message)

## Let's Fix Your Current Changes! 🔧

Right now you have changes that need to be saved. Let's do it together:

### Step 1: Add all changes
```bash
git add .
```

### Step 2: Commit with a good message
```bash
git commit -m "Removed files page and updated homepage"
```

## Pushing to GitHub 🌐

### What is GitHub?
GitHub is like **Google Drive for your code** - it stores your project online so:
- You can access it from anywhere
- Others can see your work
- You have a backup if your computer breaks

### Setting up GitHub:

#### 1. Create GitHub Account
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Create a free account

#### 2. Create New Repository
1. Click the "+" icon in top right
2. Click "New repository"
3. Name it: `my-website` (or any name you want)
4. Make it **Public** (free)
5. Don't initialize with README (you already have files)
6. Click "Create repository"

#### 3. Connect Your Local Git to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you some commands. They'll look like this:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/my-website.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!**

#### 4. Push Your Code
```bash
git push origin main
```

This uploads your code to GitHub!

---

## Future Workflow 🔄

### After you've set up GitHub:

#### Every time you make changes:

1. **Save changes locally**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your descriptive message"
   ```

2. **Upload to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

#### Before you start working (to get latest changes):
```bash
git pull origin main
```

---

## Common Problems & Solutions 🛠️

### Problem 1: "Push rejected"
```bash
# This happens when GitHub has changes you don't have
git pull origin main
git push origin main
```

### Problem 2: "Merge conflict"
Don't panic! This just means you and GitHub have different versions of the same file.
1. Open the file with conflicts
2. Look for `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `>>>>>>>`
3. Choose which version to keep
4. Remove the conflict markers
5. Add and commit again

### Problem 3: "Added file in different branch"
```bash
git checkout main
git merge your-branch-name
```

### Problem 4: "I want to undo my last commit"
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```
This undoes the commit but keeps your changes.

### Problem 5: "I want to go back to an old version"
```bash
git log --oneline
# Find the commit ID you want to go back to
git reset --hard COMMIT_ID
```

## Best Practices 🌟

### DO ✅
- Commit often with clear messages
- Pull before you push
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Check `git status` regularly
- Use GitHub as backup

### DON'T ❌
- Commit sensitive information (passwords, API keys)
- Use vague commit messages like "updates"
- Wait too long between commits
- Force push unless you know what you're doing

### Pro Tips 💡
1. **Commit after every feature**: Don't wait until the end of the day
2. **Use present tense**: "Add button" not "Added button"
3. **Be specific**: "Fix login form validation" not "Fix stuff"
4. **Check your work**: `git status` before committing
