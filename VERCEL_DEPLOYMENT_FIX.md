# Vercel Deployment Fix Guide 🚀

## Problem Identified
Your Vercel deployment is showing the default Next.js page instead of your VidCrafter website.

## Root Cause
1. **Build Configuration Issues** - Development-specific config was interfering with production
2. **Git Sync Issues** - Latest changes may not be properly pushed to GitHub
3. **Build Process** - Vercel needs clean, production-ready configuration

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Next.js Configuration
- Removed development-specific webpack optimizations
- Enabled `reactStrictMode: true` for production
- Cleaned up build configuration
- Kept necessary error ignoring for TypeScript/ESLint

### 2. Verified Homepage Code
Your `src/app/page.tsx` contains the correct VidCrafter website with:
- ✅ Beautiful animated background
- ✅ VidCrafter branding
- ✅ Navigation menu
- ✅ Hero section with CTA buttons
- ✅ Feature cards
- ✅ Responsive design

## 🚀 Next Steps to Deploy

### Step 1: Push Latest Changes to GitHub
```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit the fixes
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment - update Next.js config for production"

# Push to GitHub (you'll need to authenticate)
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Trigger Vercel Redeploy
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Find your project
3. Click "Redeploy" or "Deployments" → "Redeploy"
4. Or push a new commit to trigger automatic deploy

### Step 3: Check Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in Vercel:
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Your deployed URL
- `DATABASE_URL` - If using database
- Any other required API keys

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If Still Showing Default Page:

1. **Check Build Logs**
   - Go to Vercel → Your Project → Logs
   - Look for build errors

2. **Verify GitHub Sync**
   ```bash
   git status
   git log --oneline -5
   ```

3. **Clear Vercel Cache**
   - Vercel → Project → Settings → Git → Redeploy
   - Or add `?force=true` to deploy

4. **Check Branch**
   - Make sure Vercel is deploying from `main` branch
   - Vercel → Project → Settings → Git

### Common Issues & Solutions:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Build fails | Check `npm run build` locally |
| Wrong page shows | Verify `src/app/page.tsx` is correct |
| API errors | Check environment variables |
| Styles missing | Verify Tailwind CSS build |

- [ ] `npm run build` works locally
- [ ] All changes committed to Git
